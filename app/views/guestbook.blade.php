                I have made an executive decision, I will start a very strict DIET so that I will look better in all the wedding pictures. Well I'll try anyway! I'm very happy for the both of you; you look cute together.

                Congratulations and much love from the bottom of my heart to the both of you.  I can not wait to see you both mark the beginning of your lives together as husband and wife.  I couldn't possibly be any happier for the two of you.

                Congrats Nate & Jaclyn!  We are so happy for you. We can't wait 194 days until the wedding. We better have a sitter or else I am going solo!  Best wishes on your upcoming nuptials and a long and happy life together!    <br /><br />
