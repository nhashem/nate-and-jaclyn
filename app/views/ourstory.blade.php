                <p>In the Spring of 2008, Jaclyn found out that two of her closest friends from high school had gotten engaged. Both of her friends' grooms-to-be were intelligent, kind, witty, and successful men. Needless to say, she wanted to find what they had found. She learned that they both met their mates on popular online dating websites. This was something completely foreign to her, but decided to give it a shot. She convinced one of her friends to give it a whirl with her. They started with three month memberships to see how it went. After making profiles it only took about 24 hours before the girls were enthusiastically amused by the attention they were receiving. Jaclyn and her friend had a bunch of interesting conversations and a few dates with some eligible Los Angeles bachelors, but no one sparked much interest in either of them. Her friend wasn't convinced this online dating thing was worth continuing, but Jaclyn kept on trying.  Finally in the fifth month she received a match.com email with the subject line: "I'm shy and can't make anyone laugh." Of course she laughed and read on.</p>

                <p>Nate had gradually witnessed all his friends get into relationships, and by 2008 he realized he was pretty much the only single person any time his friends got together.  By the end of the summer he was intentionally skipping his friends' birthdays and only showed up for drinks afterward so he wouldn't be the only one without a date.  Sure enough, after yet another 'setup' by well-meaning friends failed, he also found himself entering the world of online dating.  After a few months of mediocre dates, he came across a profile that especially caught his eye.  Seeing as how the girl's profile said she likes social guys with a good sense of humor, he decided to send a message with a subject line claiming he was the exact opposite of that.  Sure enough, it caught her attention, and within a week they had talked on the phone and made plans to meet up. </p>

                <p>Nate and Jaclyn had their first date on a Friday at The Wilshire on Wilshire Blvd in Santa Monica. They instantly hit it and off and shared a lot of laughs.  Nate was taken by Jaclyn and determined to set up their 2nd date before the night was over. They talked about their favorite bands and both admitted they liked 80s music. Bingo! A light went off in Nate's head. He asked Jaclyn if she had ever seen the 80s cover band The Spazmatics, which always played at the Dragonfly club in Hollywood on Sundays. Two evenings later they were dancing to‘"Rebel Yell" and "White Wedding." Hmm, White Wedding...</p>

                <p>It only took a few weeks for these two to call it official. They canceled their online profiles and a few months later, "like"’had blossomed into "love."  By that summer Jaclyn knew she had found her life-long companion. Nate was exactly the man she was searching for and she was convinced he was the one. Nate loved her free spirit personality it felt so great being with someone he could truly be himself with.  There was no question he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Jaclyn.</p>

                <p>On October 2nd, 2010 Nate made a reservation for dinner at Sushi Roku on the beach in Santa Monica.  Over dinner they talked about their relationship and how happy they were together.  After dinner Nate asked Jaclyn to go for a walk on the beach. According to Nate the ring box was in his left side pant pocket and while they walked through the sand it kept bumping Jaclyn in the leg. Jaclyn had no clue that this was going on. She was so cold she was just trying to keep close to him to stay warm. After a long walk up the coast north of the Santa Monica Pier, Nate got down on one knee and asked Jaclyn to marry him. She said YES! Then he quickly jumped up and placed the ring on her finger. They hugged and she cried with joy. They decided to enjoy their first night as an engaged couple together and would call their parents in the morning. Both their moms cried with joy when they called them the next morning to share the news. In fact, without knowing Nate had proposed to Jaclyn on her parents 33rd wedding anniversary.</p>
                <p>Nate and Jaclyn are thrilled to be starting their life as a married couple and can't wait to celebrate it with you all.  See you at the wedding!</p>
